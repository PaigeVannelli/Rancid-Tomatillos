# Cinematic Movie Ratings

Cinematic is a movie review application.


## About
* The Rancid Tomatillos project is a two week long paired project that consisted of utilizing React to create a website that resembles Rotten Tomatoes in functionality.
* We were given full creative control with the project's design. 
* Code was written while being introduced to ReactJS, Router, and Cypress testing. 

## Installation
